A boilerplate and set of utilities for using [Directus](https://directus.io) for backend CMS and [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) (w/ [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)) for frontend. It's core feature is to **automagically** create *typed* pages the instant you create a Directus collection.

> Can be used as a boilerplate or individually as a suite of utilities.

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-nuxtus app-name

The purpose of this template is to be a quick-start for developing a website with Nuxt.js using Directus as the backend. The end result can be a static website or dynamically pull data from Directus depending on your preference.

It also includes [nuxtus/cli]("https://github.com/nuxtus/cli") which provides a command line interface for quickly creating multiple index/detail pages from any Directus collections.
