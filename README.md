The purpose of this template is to be a quick-start for developing a website with Nuxt.js using Directus as the backend. The end result can be a static website or dynamically pull data from Directus depending on your preference.

It also includes [nuxtus/cli]("https://github.com/nuxtus/cli") which provides a command line interface for quickly creating multiple index/detail pages from any Directus collections.
