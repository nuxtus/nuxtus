The purpose of this template is to be a quick-start for developing a website with Nuxt.js using Directus as the backend. The end result can be a static website or dynamically pull data from Directus depending on your preference.

It also includes [nuxtus/cli]("https://github.com/nuxtus/cli") which provides a command line interface for quickly creating multiple index/detail pages from any Directus collections.

## Quickstart (preferred)

```

> Replace `app-name` with the name of your website or application.

Nuxtus will automatically migrate the Directus DB if you are using SQLite. Otherwise follow the directions below to manually configure your database and get started.

Your project will contain 2 folders server (Directus) and client (Nuxt).

### Directus

By default Nuxtus uses an SQLite database. If you wish to use an alternative database simply edit the `server/.env` file as suggested in the [Directus documentation](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/config-options/#database) then follow the steps below.

```bash
$ cd server

# From within the root of the project
$ npm run cli bootstrap
```

### Nuxt

No set up for Nuxt is required.

### Starting Nuxtus

From inside your project folder:

```bash
$ npm start
```

### Creating pages

Nuxtus includes Nuxtus CLI which will automatically generate listing and view pages of any Directus collections. To use it:

1. Log in to Directus ([http://0.0.0.0:8055/admin/login](http://0.0.0.0:8055/admin/login)) and [create a collection](https://docs.directus.io/configuration/data-model/#creating-a-collection)
2. From the client folder (`cd client`) run `nuxtus create` and follow the prompts

Pages will be created for each collection you select in `clients/pages`. These are a starting point for you to customise.

## Production deployment

By default Directus is configured to accept CORS from any origin. Nuxtus suggests modifying this for your production deployment.
